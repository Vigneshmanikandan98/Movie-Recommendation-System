# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using collaborative filtering techniques. It recommends movies to users based on their previous ratings and preferences. The system uses the MovieLens dataset for training and testing purposes.

## Features
1. Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user ratings.
2. Matrix Factorization: Implements a matrix factorization approach using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the user-movie rating matrix.
3. Tuning Hyperparameters: Uses iterative processes like stochastic gradient descent for optimizing hyperparameters.


## Dataset
The project uses the MovieLens dataset provided by MovieLens, which contains millions of user ratings for movies.

## Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Tqdm: For progress tracking.
